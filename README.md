Please implement this method to return a new array where the order of elements has been reversed from the original array.

2.

Towers Of Hanoi. There are three pegs: A, B and C. There are n disks. All disks are different in size. The disks are initially stacked on peg A so that they increase in size from the top to the bottom. The goal is to transfer the entire tower from the A peg to the C peg. One disk at a time can be moved from the top of a stack either to an empty peg or to a peg with a larger disk than itself on the top of its stack. The method should return a sequence of disk moves, each move is a String with two letters (A, B or C) corresponding to the peg the disk moves from and the peg it moves to.  For example, the move "AC" means that a top disk from peg A should be moved to peg C.
